Matlab files used for analyses.
Analyses are saved by figure(s) name.
Other files correspond either to functions used by the figName.m files or to analyses that were not illustrated graphically.

Relevant data is available at the "data" and "hddm related code and data" directory.

Note that you must unzip the ppc_data files in each "hddm related code and data/DATASET_NAME". 
Also note that PPC_loop.m is required for multiple figures. It will only run once and then use the relevant data stored in "data/PPC_loop_data.mat".
